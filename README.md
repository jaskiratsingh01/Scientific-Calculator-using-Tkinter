# Scientific-Calculator-using-Tkinter
For this project, we have used python programming language for coding and we have used TKINTER for graphical user interface to make it more convenient for user.  Additionally we have used Text To Speak Module for User feedback. For this we use ‘pyttsx3’ module. In which when we click a button voice came as feedback. To make it lag free, we also use some Threading concept. We have provide various features for user. User can select whether he want voice or not and if he want he can select Male or Female Voice. Overall we have made a very friendly user interface for calculations.
